## questions 1-2
* in this pset we have 2 houses in pacman world - Food house and Ghost house;
we have to infer where Food house based on observations (?);
* here we build Bayes net from pset - basically it represents our 2 houses
and a bunch of observation; we add nodes (variables), edges and domains for
variables (question 1); and CPTs (question2);

## questions 3-5
* here we implement basic operations for factors: `join`, `eliminate` and
`normalize`;
